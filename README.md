This headphone amplifier built from discrete components is a big step forward from a Cmoy like headphone amplifier. It was designed by Lineup, a forum member of diyaudio.com.

It is very easy to build, beginner friendly I think, uses cheap components, Class-A, tolerant, and sounds fantastic. My first impression is the power and impact it has, without raising the volume.
"Smooth", "impressed", "nice clarity and detail", "Vocals are clear and bass is good" are a few comments. I fully endorse these.

The schematics for one channel:

U1 (volume) is a logaritmic stereo potmeter, U2 (balance) is a lineair mono potmeter. If balance control is not used, R9 can be omitted. R8 are the headphones, 32 ohm or higher.

Q1 and Q2 can be replaced with BC547 and BC557 respectively. For Q3 originally a BD139 transistor was used. Like said the circuit is pretty tolerant of using different components. I mostly used leftover components without problems.

Q3 becomes a bit hot so this transistor should be mounted on a small heatsink. R1, R6 and R7 also heat up. Use 3 to 5 Watt type resistors for these.

Being such a simple circuit a piece of perfboard is used, one for each channel. And I added a balance control to compensate for hearing and recording problems.

I used an old 12V switched power supply without any problems. The amplifier is free of hum and noise.
